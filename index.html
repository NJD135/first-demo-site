                        <p class="firstPara">
                            I've always been intrigued by coding, web development and this kind of things. But at the same time it felt like an obscure land to me. Well it is kind of an obscure land where I live.
                        </p>
                        <h3>But I'm learning!</h3>
                        <p class="secondPara">
                            Even though I felt uncertain I started with learning HTML, after completeing my bachelor degree in physics, from online sources and also was able to find a helpful offline comunity. I'm even more interested now in learning all these stuff. Now I must thank one of my friends who showed me the road ahead. I'm eternally thankful to him.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Interests?</h3>
                        <p class="thirdPara">
                            Other than programming, I'm a huge fan of anime and music. Old, new, regional, folk, all kind of music.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Thank you!</h3>
                        <p class="lastPara">
                            Welp! It's been my first live webpage, and by any chance if you took the time to look at it I'm really thankful. Without making it any more cheesy, I'll take my leave. Bye!
